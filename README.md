# Summary
We worked as partners to determine which neighborhood was the best the raise a child in by utilizing pandas, 
numpy, and matplotlib. We decided that we would look to see which neighborhoods had the most people attending 
playgrounds for the social aspect, traffic signs to gauge how cautious drivers would be forced to be for safety,
and the number of trees to see if kidnappers would have more hiding spots if they were to abduct a child.
